# Upgrades

Strapi periodically releases code improvements through new versions. New Strapi versions are announced in both the terminal and in the administration panel, and [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases) list what is new with each new version.

The [upgrade tool](/dev-docs/upgrade-tool) documentation should help migrating to a new Strapi version.
