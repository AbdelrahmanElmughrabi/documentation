# Migrating from Strapi v4 to Strapi 5

The latest major version of Strapi is v5. Migrating from Strapi v4 to v5 includes handling breaking changes and specific migration steps.

:::danger
It is currently strongly advised that you refrain from migrating from Strapi v4 to Strapi 5, especially in a production environment.

The beta version of Strapi 5 is not meant to be used in production yet.
:::

The [upgrade tool](/dev-docs/upgrade-tool) and its codemods should automate some parts of the migration from v4 to Strapi 5. Additional information is also given below about breaking changes.
