</CustomDocCardsWrapper> -->

## Accessing the admin panel

The admin panel is the back office of your Strapi application. From the admin panel, you will be able to manage content-types, and write their actual content. It is also from the admin panel that you will manage users, both administrators and end users of your Strapi application.

:::caution
In order to access the admin panel, your Strapi application must be launched, and you must be aware of the URL to its admin panel (e.g. `api.example.com/admin`).

    light: '/img/assets/getting-started/login-page-sso.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/getting-started/login-page_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

To access the admin panel:

1. Go to the URL of your Strapi application's admin panel.
2. Enter your credentials to log in.
3. Click on the **Login** button. You should be redirected to the homepage of the admin panel.

### Using SSO for authentication <EnterpriseBadge />

If your Strapi application was configured to allow authentication through SSO (see [Configuring Single Sign-On](/user-docs/settings/single-sign-on)), you can access the admin panel using a specific provider instead of logging in with a regular Strapi administrator account.

To do so, in the login page of your Strapi application, click on a chosen provider. If you cannot see your provider, click the ![icon more](/img/assets/getting-started/icon_more.png) button to access the full list of all available providers. You will be redirected to your provider's own login page where you will be able to authenticate.

## Setting up your administrator profile

If you are a new administrator, we recommend making sure your profile is all set, before diving into your Strapi application. From your administrator profile, you are able to modify your user information, such as name, username, email or password. You can also choose the language of the interface for your Strapi application.
